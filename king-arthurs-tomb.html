  <p><b>KING ARTHUR'S TOMB</b></p>
  <p>Hot August noon—already on that day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Since sunrise through the Wiltshire downs, most sad <br>
    Of mouth and eye, he had gone leagues of way; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ay and by night, till whether good or bad</p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>He was, he knew not, though he knew perchance <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That he was Launcelot, the bravest knight<br>
    Of all who since the world was, have borne lance, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Or swung their swords in wrong cause or in right.</p>
  <p>Nay, he knew nothing now, except that where <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The Glastonbury gilded towers shine,<br>
    A lady dwelt, whose name was Guenevere;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    This he knew also; that some fingers twine,</p>
    
  <p>Not only in a man's hair, even his heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    (Making him good or bad I mean,) but in his life,<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>15</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Skies, earth, men's looks and deeds, all that has part,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Not being ourselves, in that half-sleep, half-strife,</p>
  <p>(Strange sleep, strange strife,) that men call living; so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Was Launcelot most glad when the moon rose,<br>
    Because it brought new memories of her.  "Lo,<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Between the trees a large moon, the wind lows</p>
  <p>&quot;Not loud, but as a cow begins to low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Wishing for strength to make the herdsman hear: <br>
    The ripe corn gathereth dew; yea, long ago, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In the old garden life, my Guenevere</p>
          <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>25</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;Loved to sit still among the flowers, till night <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Had quite come on, hair loosen'd, for she said,<br>
    Smiling like heaven, that its fairness might <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Draw up the wind sooner to cool her head.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now while I ride how quick the moon gets small,<br>
  </p>

         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As it did then—I tell myself a tale<br>
    That will not last beyond the whitewashed wall, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thoughts of some joust must help me through the vale,</p>
  <p>&quot;Keep this till after—How Sir Gareth ran<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A good course that day under my Queen's eyes,<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>35</td></tr></tbody></table>
    And how she sway'd laughing at Dinadan—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    No—back again, the other thoughts will rise,</p>
  <p>&quot;And yet I think so fast 'twill end right soon—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Verily then I think, that Guenevere,<br>
    Made sad by dew and wind, and tree-barred moon, <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Did love me more than ever, was more dear</p>
  <p>&quot;To me than ever, she would let me lie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And kiss her feet, or, if I sat behind, <br>
    Would drop her hand and arm most tenderly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And touch my mouth. And she would let me wind</p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>45</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;Her hair around my neck, so that it fell <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Upon my red robe, strange in the twilight<br>
    With many unnamed colours, till the bell <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of her mouth on my cheek sent a delight</p>
  <p>&quot;Through all my ways of being; like the stroke <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>50</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Wherewith God threw all men upon the face<br>
    When he took Enoch, and when Enoch woke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With a changed body in the happy place.</p>
  <p>&quot;Once, I remember, as I sat beside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    She turn'd a little, and laid back her head, <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>55</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And slept upon my breast: I almost died<br>
    In those night-watches with my love and dread,</p>
  <p>&quot;There lily-like she bow'd her head and slept,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And I breathed low, and did not dare to move,<br>
    But sat and quiver'd inwardly, thoughts crept, <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>60</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And frighten'd me with pulses of my Love.</p>
  <p>&quot;The stars shone out above the doubtful green <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of her bodice, in the green sky overhead;<br>
    Pale in the green sky were the stars I ween, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Because the moon shone like a star she shed</p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>65</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;When she dwelt up in heaven a while ago, </p>

  <p><font color="#6B6646" size="-1">[p. 56]</font></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And ruled all things but God: the night went on, <br>
    The wind grew cold, and the white moon grew low, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    One hand had fallen down, and now lay on</p>
  <p>&quot;My cold stiff palm; there were no colours then<br>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>70</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For near an hour, and I fell asleep<br>
    In spite of all my striving, even when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I held her whose name-letters make me leap.</p>
  <p>&quot;I did not sleep long, feeling that in sleep <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I did some loved one wrong, so that the sun <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>75</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Had only just arisen from the deep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Still land of colours, when before me one</p>
  <p>&quot;Stood whom I knew, but scarcely dared to touch, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    She seemed to have changed so in the night; <br>
    Moreover she held scarlet lilies, such<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>80</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As Maiden Margaret bears upon the light</p>
  <p>&quot;Of the great church walls, natheless did I walk <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Through the fresh wet woods, and the wheat that morn,<br>
    Touching her hair and hand and mouth, and talk <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of love we held, nigh hid among the corn.</p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>85</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;Back to the palace, ere the sun grew high, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    We went, and in a cool green room all day <br>
    I gazed upon the arras giddily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Where the wind set the silken kings a-sway.</p>
  <p>&quot;I could not hold her hand, or see her face;<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>90</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For which may God forgive me! but I think, <br>
    Howsoever, that she was not in that place.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    These memories Launcelot was quick to drink;</p>
  <p>And when these fell, some paces past the wall, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    There rose yet others, but they wearied more, <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>95</td></tr></tbody></table>
    And tasted not so sweet; they did not fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    So soon, but vaguely wrenched his strained heart sore</p>
  <p>In shadowy slipping from his grasp; these gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A longing followed; if he might but touch<br>
    That Guenevere at once! Still night, the lone<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Grey horse's head before him vex'd him much,</p>
  <p>In steady nodding over the grey road—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Still night, and night, and night, and emptied heart <br>
    Of any stories; what a dismal load<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Time grew at last, yea, when the night did part,</p>
  <p><font color="#6B6646" size="-1">[p. 57]</font></p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>105</td></tr></tbody></table>
    And let the sun flame over all, still there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The horse's grey ears turn'd this way and that,<br>
    And still he watch'd them twitching in the glare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of the morning sun, behind them still he sat,</p>
  <p>Quite wearied out with all the wretched night,<br>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>110</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Until about the dustiest of the day,<br>
    On the last down's brow he drew his rein in sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of the Glastonbury roofs that choke the way.</p>
  <p>And he was now quite giddy as before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    When she slept by him, tired out and her hair <br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>115</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Was mingled with the rushes on the floor, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And he, being tired too, was scarce aware</p>
  <p>Of her presence; yet as he sat and gazed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A shiver ran throughout him, and his breath<br>
    Came slower, he seem'd suddenly amazed,<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>120</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As though he had not heard of Arthur's death.</p>
  <p>This for a moment only, presently<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He rode on giddy still, until he reach'd <br>
    A place of apple-trees, by the thorn-tree <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Wherefrom St. Joseph in the days past preached.</p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>125</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>Dazed there he laid his head upon a tomb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Not knowing it was Arthur's, at which sight<br>
    One of her maidens told her, &quot;he is come,&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And she went forth to meet him; yet a blight</p>
  <p>Had settled on her, all her robes were black,<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>130</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With a long white veil only; she went slow, <br>
    As one walks to be slain, her eyes did lack<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Half her old glory, yea, alas! the glow</p>
  <p>Had left her face and hands; this was because <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As she lay last night on her purple bed,<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>135</td></tr></tbody></table>
    1ishing for morning, grudging every pause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of the palace clocks, until that Launcelot's head</p>
  <p>Should lie on her breast, with all her golden hair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Each side—when suddenly the thing grew drear, <br>
    In morning twilight, when the grey downs bare<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>140</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Grew into lumps of sin to Guenevere.</p>
  <p>At first she said no word, but lay quite still, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Only her mouth was open, and her eyes <br>
    Gazed wretchedly about from hill to hill;</p>
  <p><font color="#6B6646" size="-1">[p. 58] </font></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    As though she asked, not with so much surprise</p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>145</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>As tired disgust, what made them stand up there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So cold and grey. After, a spasm took<br>
Her face, and all her frame, she caught her hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her hair, in both hands,  terribly she shook,</p>
  <p>And rose till she was sitting in  the bed,<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>150</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Set her teeth hard, and shut her eyes and seem’d<br>
    As though she would have torn it from her head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Natheless she dropp’d it, lay down, as she deem’d</p>
  <p>It matter’d not whatever she might do — <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    O Lord Christ! pity on her ghastly face!<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>155</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Those dismal hours while the cloudless blue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Drew the sun higher—He did give her grace;</p>
  <p>Because at last she rose up from her bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And put her raiment on, and knelt before<br>
    The blessed rood, and with her dry lips said,<br>    
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>160</td></tr></tbody></table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Muttering the words against the marble floor: </p>
  <p>“Unless you pardon, what shall I do, Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    But go to hell? and there see day by day<br>
    Foul deed on deed, hear foulest word on word.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For ever and ever, such as on the way</p>
         <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>165</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>“To Camelot I heard once from a  churl,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That curled me up upon my jennet’s neck<br>
    With bitter shame; how then, Lord, should I curl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    For ages and for ages? dost thou reck</p>
  <p>“That I am beautiful, Lord, even as you<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And your dear Mother? why did I forget <br>
    You were so beautiful, and good, and true,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That you loved me so, Guenevere? O yet</p>
  <p>“If even I go to hell, I cannot choose <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    But love you, Christ, yea, though I cannot keep<br>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>175</td></tr></tbody></table>
    From loving Launcelot; O Christ!  must I lose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My own heart’s love? see, though I  cannot weep,</p>
  <p>“Yet am I very sorry for my sin;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Moreover, Christ, I cannot bear that hell, <br>
    I am most fain to love you, and to win<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A place in heaven some time—I cannot tell—</p>
  <p>“Speak to me, Christ! I kiss, kiss, kiss your feet;</p>
  <p><font color="#6B6646" size="-1">[p. 59]</font></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Ah! now I weep!” —The maid said, “By  the tomb<br>
    He waiteth for you, lady,” coming fleet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Not knowing what woe filled up all the room.</p>
        <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>185</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>So Guenevere rose and went to meet him there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He did not hear her coming, as he lay<br>
    On Arthur’s head, till some of her long hair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Brush’d on the new-cut stone — “Well done! to pray</p>
  <p>“For Arthur, my dear lord, the  greatest king<br>

    I am not mad, but I am sick; they cling,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Wrung heart, how first before the knights there came<br>
    A royal bier, hung round with green and blue, <br>

  <p>&quot;And thereupon Lucius, the Emperor,<br>

    Not able to hold sword or sceptre more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    But not quite grim; because his cloven head</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Being by embalmers deftly solder'd up;<br>

  <p>&quot;Also the heralds sung rejoicingly<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    But rather Arthur, God would not let die,</p>

    Kissing my face, half blinded with the heat <br>

  <p>&quot;Launcelot, Launcelot, why did he take your hand, <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Calls Arthur's banner, sword, and shield to-day;</p>
  <p>&quot;'Cherish him, love.' Why did your long lips cleave <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In such strange way unto my fingers then? <br>
    So eagerly glad to kiss, so loath to leave<br>
