  <p>The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:  <br>

    No man could tell the better of the two.</p>
  <p>&quot;After a shivering half-hour you said,<br>

    Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,</p>

  <p>&quot;It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came</p>
  <p><font color="#6B6646" size="-1">[p. 47]</font></p>
  <p> To dwell at Arthur's  court: at Christmas-time <br>
    This happened; when the heralds sung his name,</p>
  <p>&quot;'Son of King Ban of Benwick,' seemed to chime <br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>65</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Along with all the bells that rang that day,                                              <br>
    O'er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme.</p>
  <p>&quot;Christmas and whitened winter passed away, <br>

    Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea</p>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>70</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;And in Summer I grew white with flame,                                              <br>
    And bowed my head down—Autumn, and the sick <br>
    Sure knowledge things would never be the same,</p>
  <p>&quot;However often Spring might be most thick<br>
    Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew<br>

    Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,                          </p>
  <p>&quot;To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through <br>
    My eager body; while I laughed out loud, <br>
    And let my lips curl up at false or true,</p>
  <p>&quot;Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud.<br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>80</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Behold my judges, then the cloths were brought:                                    <br>
    While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd,</p>
  <p>&quot;Belonging to the time ere I was bought<br>
    By Arthur's great name and his little love, <br>
    Must I give up for ever then, I thought,</p>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>85</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;That which I deemed would ever round me move                                 <br>
    Glorifying all things; for a little word, <br>
    Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove</p>
  <p>&quot;Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord<br>
    Will that all folks should be quite happy and good? <br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>90</td></tr></tbody></table>
    I love God now a little, if this cord                                                         </p>

    Make me love anything in earth or heaven. <br>
    So day by day it grew, as if one should</p>
  <p>&quot;Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even, <br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>95</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Down to a cool sea on a summer day;                                       </p>
  <p><font color="#6B6646" size="-1">[p. 48]</font></p>
  <p>Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven</p>
  <p>&quot;Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way, <br>
    Until one surely reached the sea at last, <br>
    And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay</p>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past                          <br>
    Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips, <br>
    Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast</p>
  <p>&quot;In the lone sea, far off from any ships! <br>
    Do I not know now of a day in Spring? <br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>105</td></tr></tbody></table>
    No minute of that wild day ever slips                                                     </p>
  <p>&quot;From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing, <br>
    And wheresoever I may be, straightway<br>
    Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting;</p>
  <p>&quot;I was half mad with beauty on that day, <br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>110</td></tr></tbody></table>
    And went without my ladies all alone,                                        <br>
    In a quiet garden walled round every way;</p>
  <p>&quot;I was right joyful of that wall of stone,<br>
    That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky, <br>
    And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,</p>

  <p>&quot;Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy                          <br>
    With weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad; <br>
    Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,</p>
  <p>&quot;A little thing just then had made me mad; <br>
    I dared not think, as I was wont to do, <br>

    Sometimes, upon my beauty; if I had                                                     </p>
  <p>&quot;Held out my long hand up against the blue, <br>
    And, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers,<br>
    Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,</p>
  <p>&quot;There, see you, where the soft still light yet  lingers, <br>

  <p>&quot;When both our mouths went wandering in one way, <br>
    And aching sorely, met among the leaves; <br>
    Our hands being left behind strained far away.</p>

  <p>&quot;And wonder how the light is falling so                                       <br>
    Within my moving tresses: will you dare, <br>
    When you have looked a little on my brow,</p>
  <p>&quot;To say this thing is vile? or will you care <br>

    'But in your chamber Launcelot was found'—<br>

    When I was young, and green hope was in sight;                                   </p>

   To see you, Launcelot; that we may be                                      <br>
    Like children once again, free from all wrongs</p>
  <p>&quot;'Just for one night.' Did he not come to me? <br>
    What thing could keep true Launcelot away<br>
    If I said 'come?' there was one less than three</p>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>265</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;In my quiet room that night, and we were gay;                          <br>
    Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick, <br>
    Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea</p>
  <p>&quot;I looked at Launcelot's face and could not speak,<br>
    For he looked helpless too, for a little while; <br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>270</td></tr></tbody></table>
    Then I remember how I tried to shriek,                                      </p>
  <p><font color="#6B6646" size="-1">[p. 53]</font></p>
  <p>&quot;And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile <br>
    The stones they threw up rattled o'er my head, <br>
    And made me dizzier; till within a while</p>
  <p>&quot;My maids were all about me, and my head<br>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>275</td></tr></tbody></table>
    On Launcelot's breast was being soothed away                         <br>
    From its white chattering, until Launcelot said—</p>
  <p>&quot;By God! I will not tell you more to-day, <br>
    Judge any way you will—what matters it? <br>
    You know quite well the story of that fray,</p>
       <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" width="7%"><tbody><tr><td>280</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p>&quot;How Launcelot still'd their bawling, the mad fit                                     <br>
    That caught up Gauwaine—all, all, verily,<br>
    But just that which would save me; these things flit.</p>
  <p>&quot;Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie, <br>
    Whatever may have happen'd these long years,<br>

    God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie!                             </p>
  <p>&quot;All I have said is truth, by Christ's dear  tears.&quot; <br>
    She would not speak another word, but stood <br>
    Turn'd sideways; listening, like a man who hears</p>
  <p>His brother's trumpet sounding through the wood<br>

    Of his foes' lances. She lean'd eagerly,                                       <br>
    And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could</p>
  <p>At last hear something really; joyfully<br>
    Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed <br>
    Of the roan charger drew all men to see,<br>
